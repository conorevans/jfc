Flights[] flights;
void fromFile(File f) // at the beginning, as there are many flights from the past to catalogue, we will create all flight objects from a structured file
void fromString(String s) // once the backlog is dealt with, flights will be added individually as they come in

Each object is a flight, with the following attributes:

Date dateOfOffer // The date the e-mail was sent to me.

Airport departureAirport 
Airport destinationAirport
//Each airport will have an ISO tag, layperson tag, Country

String airline 

String durationOfOffer // The e-mail will state the expected duration; there are a couple of typical durations that will cover most.

String travelDates // The e-mail will state the window during which the offers are valid.

int price 
int typicalPrice 

int saving 
double savingAsPercent

boolean bagIncluded

The following methods will act on the Flight objects :

String printSingleLine() //prints essential details, on one line. This is to make it more concise when several are printed at once
String printPretty() // prints in more user-friendly format
String printFromCountry(String country) // print all from %country%
String printFromAirport(Airport departureAirport) // prints all departures from %departureAirport%

boolean cheaperThanUsual() // run on a flight, will see if there is any data with flights of identical departureAirport/destinationAirport and return whether it is cheaper than usual, and the proportion.

boolean stillValid() // used to separate previous flights from currently active ones.
